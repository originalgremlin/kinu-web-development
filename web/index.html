		We're not doing much, and there are already 5 script includes.

		When the project grows there can sometimes be 50 or even 100 of these includes,
		all depending on other scripts (like backbone depends on jquery).  This can be
		a nightmare to maintain.  We also end up polluting the global namespace with dozens
		of class names.

		Pretty soon we're going to have to do something about this.  One popular solution
		is to use the require.js AMD library to asynchronously calculate module dependencies
		and load our scripts.

		A much better place is in the web/templates/ directory.  They can go there
